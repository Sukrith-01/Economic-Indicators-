Economic Indicators and Inflation Analysis
Overview
Welcome to the Economic Indicators and Inflation Analysis project! This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between key economic indicators and inflation trends. By leveraging data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover insights into how economic metrics influence inflation, offering valuable perspectives for economists, policymakers, and enthusiasts.

Project Description
This project examines critical economic indicators—such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, unemployment rates, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), interest rates, and money supply—and their impact on inflation. Through historical data analysis and predictive modeling, it seeks to:

Identify patterns and correlations between economic indicators and inflation rates.
Assess the effects of fiscal/monetary policies and external factors (e.g., global events, supply chain disruptions) on inflationary trends.
Provide actionable insights for understanding economic health and forecasting inflation.
Features
Data Analysis: Cleaned and processed datasets of economic indicators and inflation metrics.
Visualizations: Charts and graphs (e.g., time series, scatter plots) to illustrate trends and relationships.
Modeling: Statistical or machine learning models to predict inflation based on indicator data.
Documentation: Detailed explanations of methodologies and findings.
